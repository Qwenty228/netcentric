# 2190472 Netcentric: Project Battleship - Godot Client

Welcome to the **Battleship** project for the course **2190472 Netcentric**. This project implements a multiplayer version of the classic Battleship game using the Godot Engine. This document outlines the client-side implementation of the Battleship game, allowing players to connect and play against each other via the Godot client.

## Overview
The Battleship project simulates the classic board game where two players position ships on a grid and attempt to sink each other's fleet. The game runs over a network, with one player acting as the server and the other as the client. Communication between players is handled using **TCP sockets** in Godot, providing a seamless networked experience.
